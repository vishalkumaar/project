Jerry : A voice/web-based device-controller.

The idea behind ‘Jerry!’ is to build a voice-command based controller which manages devices like lights and fans etc. making it interactive and efficient at the same time.

All voice interactions with the user are handled by the Web application Interface.

You supply one or more reliable content feeds in RSS or JSON format. The content can be audio content that the device plays to the customer or text content that device reads to the customer.

The code then handles the request appropriately. I.e. it will handle the request in sequence that the user provides. With respect to GUI, the dashboard is designed to make it as user friendly as possible and to keep it simple overall.

Micro framework like flask makes the application light and accommodative of most browsers.

The system also has a dashboard which lets the user view his/her list of devices and operate them with GUI as well.
